To whom it may Concern,

I, Harbin Wester, Town master of Phandalin, Come to thee for aid in these troubling times.

A dim-witted and cruel white-dragon has settled in the Sword Mountains. With each passing day, the dragon's domain grows as It ranges further across the land, preying on anything It can catch with its claws or freeze to death with its icy breath.

The dragon has now set its eyes on Phandalin. It has already taken many of our flock. We fear lest our people will be its next prey.

As if thatÂ  was not enough, the lands surrounding us have been infested with Orcs and other terrifying creatures.

Several men have gone after the dragon in order to protect our livelihood. They have not yet returned, leaving our village vulnerable.

We are in dire need of assistance. Please send us as many capable people as you can spare and I will personally reward them with gold.

Yours sincerely,

Townmaster Harbin Wester
