**The Prophecy: The Year Of Three Ships Sailing (1492 DR):**

In the Year of the Three Ships Sailing, five formidable entities shall arise: the Shadow of War, the Master of Time, the Tide of Destruction, the Keeper of Memories, and the [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Calamities/Cryovain\|Ice Tyrant]]. Their paths shall intertwine, and the world shall teeter on the edge of chaos. Only by the hand of five champions, guided by an ancient power, can balance be restored. Should they falter, the realm will plunge into eternal doom; should they prevail, salvation shall be theirs.
