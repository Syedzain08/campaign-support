## Appearance

Percia glides through the palace like a stern winter wind, her gowns always in the deepest hues of nobility. A silver pendant bearing her house's symbol rests at her throat, gleaming with ancient prestige. Her stern expression and arched eyebrow have ended more courtly careers than any royal decree. She wields an ornate fan with the precision of a master swordsman, its movements as telling as any spoken word.

## Personality

Percia's most defining trait is her overwhelming sense of superiority. In her eyes, nearly everyone is beneath her station, a view she makes no effort to conceal. Her words, when she deigns to speak to lesser folk, are clipped and precise, each syllable dripping with generations of perceived refinement. 

This superiority complex is coupled with an unwavering, almost fanatical loyalty to the Queen-regent. Percia is the unyielding voice of tradition and stability, viewing herself as the guardian of the old ways that have kept the kingdom strong. Her keen eyes miss nothing, cataloging every twitch and tell of those who seek audience.

## Role and Influence

As the Queen's Right Hand, Percia wields immense power. When the Queen speaks, it is often Percia's words that flow from royal lips. In private councils, she is both the voice of caution and the architect of policy, ever watchful for threats to her Queen's regency. Her privilege to stand beside the throne is unquestioned, making her unimaginably wealthy in the currency of courtly influence.

## Background and Motivations

Born of ancient blood, Percia views her position not as an honor but as her birthright and solemn duty. However, beneath her immovable exterior lies a quiet unease. She's acutely aware that the Queen's reign—and perhaps her own influence—has an expiration date, with the true king's eventual return looming on the horizon.

## Conclusion

Percia Elara Ravencrest stands as a formidable figure in the current political landscape. Her actions, driven by her superiority complex and unwavering loyalty, have far-reaching consequences. As the realm approaches a pivotal moment with the impending return of the true king, Percia's role in shaping its future—and her struggle to maintain her position—promises to be a source of intense drama and intrigue. Her presence in any scene immediately raises the stakes, offering rich opportunities for conflict, negotiation, and political maneuvering.
