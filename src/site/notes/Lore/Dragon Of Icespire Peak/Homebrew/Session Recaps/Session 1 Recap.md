# The story till now.

Session 1

Our intrepid heroes met each other at [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] and immediately found out about the white dragon, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Calamities/Cryovain\|Cryovain]], who has settled in the sword mountains, driving out the orcs. Our heroes spent the first night at the stonehill inn.

After waking up, our heroes went to the town hall to get a quest, they received the said quest and departed immediately. They went to the dwarven excavation, on their way to the site, they stopped by a lake to cool off and take a swim, accidentally summoning the terror of the 12 seas, The Kraken.

Our hero, reignleif caught under its eldritch blast, he was saved due to his luck, when the fabled white dragon came to try to kill its long lost enemy, a epic fight ensued, the dragon ultimately lost one of its eye and flew off but not before tearing off a tentacle of the mythic beast. Our heroes were rescued from the brink of death by Elahorn Yistral, a celestial elf commander.

They bid Elahorn farewell, who was surprisingly rude, then went to the dwarven excavation site, not knowing what awaited them. There they saw a miniscule part of the ruins of the dwarven city of gauntlgrym. They met dazzlin and norbus, two dwarf prospectors, they gave the party yet another quest, kill two ochre jellies and receive a prize, the party, gravely underestimating their enemy, went inside, they met the two ochre jellies, and the first initiative of the campaign and their lives was rolled!

After that, the fight was incredible as they defeated the first ochre jelly, they relaxed and let their guard down, that's when the second jelly pounced, and then the tables turned, our rogue elf, agnor and our second rogue elf, fell unconscious but miraculously, didn't die, lucifer morningstar, our human fighter, was left to protect his friends and kill the ochre, will he succeed or will he die here and be buried in these ruins, forever forgotten.

That will have to wait till the next session!
