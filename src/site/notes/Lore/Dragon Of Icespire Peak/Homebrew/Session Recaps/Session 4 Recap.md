# Charters, Queens, and Gnomish Chaos

## The Party's Current State

Our heroes, known as "The Arcane Vanguard," consist of:
- [[Players/Aegnor Elessar/Aegnor Elessar\|Aegnor Elessar]]: A wood elf rogue seeking vengeance for his fallen kingdom
- [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar Norixius]]: A dragonborn cleric with a mysterious prophecy to fulfill
- [[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer Morningstar]]: A human fighter driven by a quest for justice
- [[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif Spiritwalker]]: A wood elf rogue, Aegnor's close friend and reluctant adventurer
- [[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will Buyers]]: A sorcerer with [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Kingdoms & Cities/The Netheril Empire\|Netheril]] blood, seeking vengeance against the dragon [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Calamities/Cryovain\|Cryovain]]

Fresh from their mission to [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Umbrage Hill\|Umbrage Hill]] where they rescued [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]] from a manticore, the party finds themselves back in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], ready for their next adventure.

## The Quest for a Charter

As dawn breaks over the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]], [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]] halts the party, explaining their need for an official charter to avoid travel taxes. This detour takes them to the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild\|Adventurer's Guild]], where they meet [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild/Thaelar Moonwhisper\|Thaelar Moonwhisper]], an elf who immediately recognizes [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]'s true nature despite his disguise.

## A Royal Audience in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/Heartlands/Cormyr\|Cormyr]]

[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild/Thaelar Moonwhisper\|Thaelar]] teleports the group to Suzail, capital of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/Heartlands/Cormyr\|Cormyr]], for an audience with Queen Regent [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Cormyr/Suzail/Raedra El Persekhal\|Raedra El Persekhal]]. This unexpected turn of events puts the party, especially [[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will Buyers]], in a precarious position:

- [[Players/Aegnor Elessar/Aegnor Elessar\|Aegnor]]'s noble lineage is acknowledged
- [[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif]]'s seafaring background raises no alarms
- [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]'s presence as an ice dragonborn far south piques interest
- [[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will]]'s [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Kingdoms & Cities/The Netheril Empire\|Netheril]] bloodline earns the Queen's suspicion and scorn

Despite the tense atmosphere, the Queen grants them a charter. When the party mentions their encounter with the Kraken (from Session 1), [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Cormyr/Suzail/Raedra El Persekhal\|Raedra]] reveals an ongoing war and a mysterious prophecy.

## [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]'s Prophecy

While the others prepare for their next mission, [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]] receives a message from his mentor. Meeting with the ancient dragon who raised him,  [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]] learns of another prophecy directing him to [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Kryptgarden Forest\|Kryptgarden Forest]]. This ties into his backstory of seeking redemption for [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Calamities/Cryovain\|Cryovain]] and adds a new layer to the party's quest.

## Chaos in [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Gnomengarde\|Gnomengarde]]

The rest of the party, along with [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]], set out for [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Gnomengarde\|Gnomengarde]]:

1. A wild magic surge causes havoc:
   - Will sprouts wings
   - [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]] is teleported into a waterfall

3. Inside [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Gnomengarde\|Gnomengarde]]:
   - They ignore cryptic warnings from inhabitants
   - Encounter and kill a crazed gnome scientist, shocking [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]
   - Recklessly explore and loot, battling a mimic
   - Resolve a conflict between King Korboz and King Knerkeli

## Moral Dilemmas and Party Tension

The party's actions in [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Gnomengarde\|Gnomengarde]], particularly their violence and looting, create tension with [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]. As they leave [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Quests/Gnomengarde\|Gnomengarde]] in chaos, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]] storms off, appalled by their behavior. [[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer]], perhaps driven by his sense of justice, chases after her.

## Looking Ahead

The session ends with several plot threads dangling:
1. The implications of the Queen's prophecy
2. [[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]'s mission to [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Kryptgarden Forest\|Kryptgarden Forest]]
3. The ongoing threat of [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Calamities/Cryovain\|Cryovain]]
4. The party's moral compass and potential consequences of their actions
5. The mysterious war mentioned by Queen [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Cormyr/Suzail/Raedra El Persekhal\|Raedra]]

These events build upon the party's previous adventures, deepening the complexity of their quest and challenging their individual motivations as they face an uncertain future.
