- **Transformation:** In -2204 DR, Coronal Eltargrim Irithyl, the ruler of the elven city, opened it to other races, an act known as the Opening. This welcoming gesture encouraged humans, dwarves, gnomes, and others to settle in the city, transforming it into Myth Drannor, also known as the City of Song.
