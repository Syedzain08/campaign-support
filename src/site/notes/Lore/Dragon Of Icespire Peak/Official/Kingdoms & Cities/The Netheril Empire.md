The Netheril Empire, one of the most legendary and powerful civilizations in the history of [[World/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]], was a magical empire that thrived from approximately -3859 DR to 339 DR. Renowned for its unparalleled mastery of magic, Netheril's influence and achievements continue to shape the world long after its fall.
## Rise of Netheril

Netheril began as a small collection of fishing villages along the Narrow Sea. The discovery of the Nether Scrolls, ancient artifacts of immense magical knowledge, transformed these humble settlements into a beacon of magical advancement. Under the guidance of powerful archmages, the empire expanded rapidly, its influence spreading across the lands.

## Geography and Achievements

The Netherese society was defined by its incredible magical prowess and innovation. Key features of the empire included:

- **Mythallars:** These massive magical artifacts allowed the Netherese to create and sustain floating cities called Enclaves. Mythallars could power any magic within their range without the need for spell components, fundamentally altering how magic was used.
- **Flying Cities:** Netheril's most famous and awe-inspiring creations were its flying cities, such as the renowned Enclave of Thultanthar (Shade). These cities floated high above the ground, serving as centers of magical research and governance.
- **Magic and Innovation:** Netherese arcanists constantly pushed the boundaries of magical research, creating powerful spells and artifacts. The empire's archmages were capable of casting spells far beyond the abilities of modern wizards.
- **Social Stratification:** Netheril's society was divided into different classes, with arcanists and those capable of wielding magic at the top. The common folk, known as the Low Netherese, lived simpler lives but benefited from the protection and advancements of their magical overlords.

## The Fall of Netheril: Karsus's Folly

The downfall of Netheril is closely tied to the hubris of one of its greatest archmages, Karsus. Driven by a desire for ultimate power, Karsus performed an act that would become known as Karsus's Folly.

- **Karsus's Ambition:** In 352 DR, Karsus, a prodigious and ambitious archmage, sought to prevent the collapse of the Weave, the fabric of magic itself, which was weakening due to the overuse of powerful spells. Believing he could save Netheril, he devised an unprecedented spell called Karsus's Avatar.
- **Karsus's Avatar:** This spell, a 12th-level magic, allowed Karsus to temporarily become a god by absorbing the essence of Mystryl, the goddess of magic. Karsus intended to take control of the Weave and stabilize it.
- **The Catastrophe:** Karsus successfully cast the spell and ascended to godhood, but the consequences were immediate and catastrophic. The sheer power of the spell was too much for any mortal, even Karsus, to control. The sudden disruption in the Weave caused Mystryl to die, and with her death, magic temporarily ceased to function.
- **The Fall:** The immediate loss of magic caused the flying cities of Netheril, dependent on mythallars, to plummet to the ground. The once-great empire was shattered in an instant, with many cities and countless lives lost in the cataclysm. Mystryl was later reborn as Mystra, but the damage to Netheril was irreversible.

## Legacy of Netheril

The fall of Netheril marked the end of an era of magical supremacy, but its legacy endures in several ways:

- **Ruins and Artifacts:** The ruins of Netherese cities, buried beneath the sands or submerged in the seas, are treasure troves of ancient magic and artifacts. Adventurers and scholars seek these relics to uncover the secrets of Netheril.
- **Influence on Magic:** Many spells and magical concepts originated from Netheril. Modern wizards study Netherese magic to learn from their advancements and avoid repeating their mistakes.
- **Shadow Enclaves:** Some Netherese enclaves survived the fall, such as the city of Thultanthar, also known as Shade. These enclaves continued to influence the world, often resurfacing with powerful magic and ambitious plans.

## Conclusion

The Netheril Empire stands as a testament to the heights of magical achievement and the dangers of hubris. Karsus's Folly serves as a cautionary tale about the limits of mortal power and the consequences of overreaching ambition. Though the empire fell, its legacy continues to shape the magical landscape of [[World/Faerun/Faerun\|Faerun]], offering both inspiration and warning to those who dare to wield the arcane arts.
