The Dalelands are located northeast of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/Heartlands/Cormyr\|Cormyr]] and southwest of the Moonsea, bordered by the ancient elven forest of Cormanthor. The region is characterized by its lush landscapes, including rolling hills, fertile farmland, dense forests, and clear rivers. Each dale has its own distinct geography and charm, contributing to the region's overall diversity.

## Major Dales

- **Shadowdale:** Perhaps the most famous of the Dales, Shadowdale is known for its rich history and its connection to legendary figures like [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Characters/Elminster Aumar\|Elminster Aumar]]. It is a hub of adventuring activity and a frequent target for those seeking to control the Dalelands.
- **Mistledale:** Located in the central part of the Dalelands, Mistledale is known for its open fields and fertile farmlands. The town of Ashabenford serves as the dale's central settlement.
- **Daggerdale:** To the north, Daggerdale has a history of conflict and resistance, especially against the Zhentarim. Its rugged terrain and strategic location make it a hotbed of guerilla warfare.
- **Deepingdale:** Bordering Cormanthor, Deepingdale is known for its close ties with the elves and its deep, ancient forests. The town of Highmoon is its primary settlement.
- **Battledale:** As the name suggests, Battledale has a history marked by conflicts and battles. It serves as a corridor between the Dalelands and the lands further east.

## Culture and Society

The Dalelands are known for their independent spirit and democratic traditions. Each dale governs itself, usually through councils or elected leaders, and while they share a common heritage, they fiercely maintain their autonomy. The people of the Dales are hardy, self-reliant, and often skilled in both agriculture and combat.

The region has a strong tradition of cooperation with the elves of Cormanthor, and many dalesfolk have elven ancestry or ties. This relationship is reflected in the region's respect for nature and magic.

## History and Lore

The history of the Dalelands is one of resilience and defiance. From the early days of human settlement in the shadow of the elven kingdom of Myth Drannor to the constant threats from the Zhentarim, the dales have always stood as a bastion of freedom. Many heroes and legends have emerged from these lands, and ancient ruins and artifacts from past conflicts are scattered throughout the region.
