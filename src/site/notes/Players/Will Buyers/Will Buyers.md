## Current Mission:

* An inferno of hatred burns within Will Buyers, fueled not just by the white dragon Cryovain's icy demise of his parents, but also by the scorn he receives for his heritage. Whispers claim he carries the blood of the fallen Netheril Empire, a lineage some view with suspicion and even fear, including the formidable Queen Raedra el Persakhal of Cormyr. This potent mix of vengeance, ostracization, and a connection to a powerful, lost civilization shapes Will's destiny. He is determined to hone his arcane talents, not just to confront Cryovain, but to perhaps even reclaim the legacy of the Netheril, or forge his own path entirely.

Despite his youth, Will carries himself with a seasoned weariness. His eyes, once filled with childish wonder, now flicker with a calculating intelligence and a barely suppressed fury. Will's lean frame belies a potent magical aura that crackles around him like static electricity. He favors simple, functional garb, practicality trumping aesthetics in his pragmatic world. Arcane symbols and wards are often etched into his clothing – a constant reminder of his power and his purpose. However, a subtle hint of his Netheril heritage might peek through – an intricate amulet depicting a stylized flying city, or a symbol tattooed on his skin that resembles a glyph from forgotten Netherese texts. This mark both empowers and isolates him.

## Backstory: A Spark Ignited in Ashes, Marked by Legacy

The idyllic life Will once knew vanished in an icy inferno. Cryovain, a young white dragon with a taste for destruction, descended upon his village, leaving behind a smoldering crater of ash and grief. A mere boy at the time, Will witnessed the horrific event, the image of his parents consumed by freezing breath forever etched into memory.

Consumed by an all-encompassing hatred for dragons, Will dedicated his life to mastering the arcane arts. He wandered the land, seeking out scraps of forgotten lore and cryptic rituals, his thirst for vengeance fueling his magical aptitude. He learned the art of summoning, of conjuring icy blasts, of manipulating the very fabric of reality – all with the singular goal of one day confronting Cryovain and exacting his due.

However, fate dealt him a cruel twist. During his travels, he encountered the formidable Queen Raedra el Persakhal of Cormyr. A revelation struck him like a bolt of lightning – whispers of Netheril blood coursing through his veins. The Queen's reaction was swift and harsh, her disdain for the empire's destructive magic painting Will as a potential threat. This scorn, layered upon the ashes of his past, fueled his determination even further. He wouldn't be ostracized or judged. He would prove his worth, not through the Queen's approval, but through his actions.

News of Cryovain's escalating attacks on the Sword Coast reached Will's ears. The dragon's presence in Phandalin, a bustling village he'd never called home, became a beacon he couldn't ignore. With a heart steeled by cold resolve, he set his sights on the dragon, ignoring the whispers of prophecies and the potential for greater threats. Cryovain would pay for his crimes, and Will would be the instrument of its fiery demise.

However, fate, it seemed, had other plans. Rumors of a different kind began to circulate - a prophecy hinting at a hero destined for the heart of the Kryptgarden Forest. Though Will scoffed at the notion of heroism, a flicker of unease stirred within him. Could there be a larger threat at play, a force even more malevolent than Cryovain? Regardless, his path remained clear. Whether the Kryptgarden held additional foes or not, it also held Cryovain. With a potent mix of vengeance, pragmatism, and a burning desire to defy expectations, Will Buyers ventures into the unknown, a storm cloud brewing on the horizon of Icespire Peak. His Netheril blood, a double-edged sword, simmers beneath the surface, a potential source of immense power or a target for further scorn.
