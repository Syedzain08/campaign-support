## Current Mission:

* A shroud of vengeance hangs heavy upon Aegnor Elessar, a wood elf rogue driven by the memory of a fallen kingdom. Once a prince cloaked in the opulence of trade, he now walks the path of shadows, his heart a steely resolve to see the dragon that devoured his home brought to ruin.

Aegnor's elven features hint at a life once steeped in privilege. His sharp cheekbones and piercing emerald eyes, however, now hold the glint of a seasoned survivor. Years spent honing his skills in the wilds have etched a lean musculature beneath his weathered cloak. Though he may lack the ostentatious garb of his past, the grace of his movements and the glint of finely crafted daggers strapped to his thighs betray his noble lineage.

## Backstory: From Prince to Shadow

Aegnor Elessar, prince of a once-thriving wood elf kingdom, knew a life of luxury. His days were spent traversing vibrant marketplaces, his keen eye for a bargain honed by his father, the king. Though yearning for a warrior's path, Aegnor dutifully served as a land merchant, a king's decree designed to instill humility within his heir.

But fate, it seemed, had a different path in store. A monstrous dragon, a creature of fire and fury, descended upon their kingdom, leaving behind a smoldering crater where a vibrant civilization once stood. Aegnor, his family, and a handful of survivors escaped the carnage, forever marked by the searing memory of their burning home.

Grief morphed into a steely resolve within Aegnor. The prince traded his silken robes for the garb of shadows, his merchant's wit honed into a rogue's cunning. He vanished into the wilds, the verdant embrace of the forest becoming his training ground. He learned the art of stealth, the whisper of the wind his guide, the glint of moonlight his teacher. Every rustle of leaves, every snap of a twig became a weapon in his arsenal, all in service of a singular purpose – vengeance.

News of dragon sightings on the Sword Coast reached Aegnor's ears. A flicker of hope, faint yet tenacious, ignited within him. Could this be the beast that devoured his home? With a heart cloaked in shadow and a blade thirsting for retribution, Aegnor Elessar, the fallen prince turned rogue, sets his sights on the north, a silent oath etched upon his soul – the dragon that stole his kingdom will pay in blood.
