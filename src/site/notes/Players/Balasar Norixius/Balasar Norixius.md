Balasar stands tall and proud, his scales shimmering with the cool hues of glaciers. Unlike his kin, he bears no scars of violence; his polished scales speak of a life dedicated to healing, not destruction. Though his ice dragon heritage grants him a fearsome jawline, his demeanor is gentle, often concealed by a traveler's cloak or a respectful hood.

## Backstory: A Spark of Compassion in the Dragon's Fire

The world stained crimson. The roars of battle, a symphony of chaos, echoed through the dragonborn village. Young Balasar, no more than a hatchling, witnessed the carnage firsthand. Fire and steel consumed his world, leaving behind a chilling emptiness where his family once resided. Lost and alone, the tremors of grief led him to a secluded mountain range, a place whispered to be the refuge of an ancient dragon.

There, amidst the snow-capped peaks, he found not a fearsome beast, but a creature of wisdom and weathered grace. This elder dragon, a being of legend etched in ice and time, became Balasar's sanctuary. Under the dragon's tutelage, the embers of vengeance smoldering within the young dragonborn were replaced by a spark of compassion. He learned the ancient language of healing, the power of positive energy that pulsed within him, a stark contrast to the destructive fire that coursed through most dragonborn.

Years turned to seasons, and the bond between the young cleric and the elder dragon deepened. Drawn by the promise of a new life, they ventured towards the Sword Coast, a land teeming with possibility. Phandalin, a bustling city nestled amidst rolling hills, became their haven. There, Balasar honed his skills, tending the wounds of weary travelers and spreading the word of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, a beacon of justice and order.

But a shadow soon darkened Phandalin's idyllic facade. A young white dragon, Cryovain, descended upon the region, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. The tales of its reign of terror ignited a fire within Balasar, a fire tempered not by vengeance, but by the unwavering belief in redemption. He knew, deep within his soul, that Cryovain could be more than a terror, its fury perhaps a consequence of a misguided path.

The whispers of destiny, however, took a different turn. A cryptic prophecy, delivered by a flickering candle flame or a rustling leaf carried by the wind (depending on whom you ask), spoke of a greater purpose within the heart of the Kryptgarden Forest. The details remained as elusive as the shadows that danced between the ancient trees, yet Balasar knew, with an unwavering certainty, that this was his calling. With a heavy heart, he bade farewell to the sanctuary of Phandalin, leaving behind the warmth of the city for the untamed wilderness. The echo of his mentor's wisdom and the unwavering faith in Bahamut's light became his compass, guiding him towards the mysteries that awaited within the emerald depths of the Kryptgarden Forest.
