Dear balasar norixious, 

  

I have been cast out of the Order Of The Dragons. I knew my time would not last long, for I was but a lowly half-blood servant to the pure bloods. Alas, I call upon you for yet another favor. Relieve this old man of all his duties, so that he may rest and swim peacefully in the golden showers of the halls of Bahamut.

  

Come visit this awaiting companion of yours, I have caught wind that you went to the settlement of phandalin, a wise decision it is not, but I cannot stop you, for revenge and bloodlust is the fate of every dragon kin. I just pray that you are safe.

  

I got sidetracked again, this old mind does not think straight anymore, come visit me, near the bogs of Phandalin, at dawn, before the birds wake, I shall be awaiting your arrival. With what little my eyes see nowadays, I wish to see you again. 

  

You've probably figured out who I am, so I need not state it.

Yours truly,
