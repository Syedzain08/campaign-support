## Current Mission:

* Beneath Reginleif Spiritwalker's unassuming exterior lies a heart heavy with a shared burden. A wood elf rogue and a close friend to Aegnor Elessar, he too carries the weight of a lost kingdom. While Aegnor yearns for vengeance, Reginleif seeks solace in companionship and a flicker of hope for a new beginning.

## Appearance:

Reginleif's demeanor is as calm and steady as the ocean breeze that once filled his sails. His wood elf features, devoid of ostentatious markings, reflect a life lived with quiet dignity. Years spent navigating treacherous waters have honed his physique, but his movements are more fluid than forceful. He favors practicality over ostentation, his garb a blend of worn leather and simple cloth that speaks of journeys undertaken and lessons learned. A glint of well-maintained daggers strapped to his thighs hints at a hidden reserve of skill.

## Backstory: A Friendship Forged in Ashes

Reginleif Spiritwalker, a wood elf rogue, carved his path on the open seas. Unlike Aegnor, the prince destined for land trade, Reginleif thrived amidst the rhythm of waves and the thrill of navigating uncharted waters. Their paths crossed in bustling marketplaces, a shared heritage forging a bond that transcended social ranks. A friendship blossomed, a haven of understanding amidst the pressures of their respective roles.

However, the same monstrous dragon that devoured Aegnor's kingdom extinguished Reginleif's peaceful existence. The fiery destruction left them both scarred, survivors clinging to the wreckage of their former lives. Together, they fled the smoldering ruins, seeking refuge in a distant human kingdom. Reginleif, ever the pragmatist, sought to rebuild a life based on the connections he'd fostered during his seafaring days. He yearned for a semblance of normalcy, a chance to heal the wounds etched upon his soul.

Yet, fate seemed determined to dredge up the past. Whispers of Cryovain's reign of terror on the Sword Coast reached their ears. Reginleif, witnessing the embers of vengeance rekindled in Aegnor's eyes, knew his friend wouldn't rest. Though his path led him towards peace, the bond they shared wouldn't allow him to turn a blind eye. With a heavy heart and a resolute spirit, Reginleif Spiritwalker, the once peaceful sea merchant, joins his friend on a quest for vengeance. He may not crave retribution himself, but he will stand by Aegnor, a silent tide against the storm brewing on the horizon.
